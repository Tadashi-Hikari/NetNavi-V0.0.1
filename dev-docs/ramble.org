How do I want netnavi to launch? It's going to be a big, complex project, so I need to get it out of my head that it will be manageable without tools.

I want to be able to call it from the command line to ask it a question
- it could be running as a service/daemon at startup, and I'm just calling it via client
-- This works w/ networking
* Structure
Check for running instance (process name or bound port)
if not started
- start service
spawn client or repl

I also need to remember, clojure compiles to js

Changing :main changes my jack in
