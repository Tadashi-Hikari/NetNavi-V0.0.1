Alright, bare with me. My thoughts are scatterbrained, and I am developing a system to help me cope with it. The workspace is designed to best help me manage my ADHD. I will document what I can to make it navigable for others. You may want to check out the README.md inside of the netnavi directory

The primary development files (the Leinengen and Shadow-cljs project) are under netnavi. It is a luminus project using +http-kit, +shadow-cljs, +sqlite, +graphql, +reitit

Portal is a directory that I use to sybolically link my subprojects so I can reference other code/projects from within my IDE workspace. Included in there is a symbolic link to my .emacs, .bashrc, and .gitignore, so I can make easy changes.

dev-docs is a mix of notes for me, and the future wiki/documentation that will explain this project
